# Study Aid

This program will hold notes and quiz me on them primarily and sedcondarily track how I do in those quizes. 

It also includes a user system and a local Database containing users, quizes, notes, and results of the quizes. Everything stored locally. No information sent to Github.

## To Run
First you must run init.py then main.py for each subsequent run. 

## Dependencies
sqlite3

## TODo
Display cards and other elements better (maybe with curses)

Add a way to store quiz results

## Future ideas

Implement UI with curses
